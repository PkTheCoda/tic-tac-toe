# tic-tac-toe
This tic tac toe project was creating for a current course I am currently taking.

What I learned throughout the project:

- Global and Scope of variables
- Factory Functions
- Using and manipulating objects
- Array methods like .filter and .splice
- Experimented with basic AI algorithms (never got to implementing them)

Overall, this project happened over the course of 3 days. Almost an hour and a half each day. One of the hardest parts was understanding how to not use any global code. Before, most of my projects used mainly global code, so switiching my style of coding was definitely very challenging for me. Over time however, I realized that it was incredibly easy to store fucntions and objects and call those functions. I hope to continue to improve my code further and this is one step.

Another incredibly hard part was the checking solution for the tic tac toe. At first, I tried to make a list of the solutions and used .filter and .splice. I got it to work only when a player did 3 in a row. If there was not 3 in a row victory, the game would not work. After a lot of thinking, I decided to make a list and iterate through the list and then check whether they all had the same textContent (either "X" or "O"). 

The code is a bit messy and not perfect. I hope to come back and improve this project by implement an AI you can play against that has levels (easy, medium, hard).
